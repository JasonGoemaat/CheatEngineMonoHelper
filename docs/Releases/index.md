Save file as 'monohelper.lua' in the 'autorun' directory where CE is installed

## In progress

* delete forms and unselect image on reload (mostly nicety for making changes during development of this)
* fixed parameter detection of 'single' and 'double' for XMM registers
* added filtering for field type in search window (Normal/Static/Const)
* uncheck 'HideSelection' on forms so you can see the selected items  in listViews after they've lost focus

## [Current Release 1.1.0](monohelper-1.1.0.lua)

Here is is as a table script in a cheat table: [MonoHelper.CT](Releases/MonoHelper.CT)

* Reconfigured build system (major change)
* Re-captioned windows 'Class' and 'Search' to 'Mono Class' and 'Mono Search'
* Fixed search window appearing off screen by centering it on screen when displayed
* Automatically select 'Assembly-CSharp' image if present (can always change from search form menu)
* First release created with new build system

## [Release 1.0.0](monohelper-1.1.0.lua)

* Original release should work fine, for posterity
